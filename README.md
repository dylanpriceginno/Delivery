# Delivery Maps Project
A piece of work requested by Delivery team to map results on Sunday delivery data but on a granular level. Using a preivously built model we collected required volume, cost and constant data. Fed the data into the model which output a number of fields such as Cost per parcel, Drop Density and Volume. I then grouped these by postcode, postcode district and postcode area. I mapped a both postcode district and area using Mapshaper which allowed me to build a UK heat map to visualise all these values. Below are two example visualisations using dummy data.
